# Edible Inedible Simulation

This project simulates a simple ecosystem where animals (predators and mammals) interact with plants (edible and inedible).

## Project Structure

The project consists of several classes:

- `Animal`: Base class for all animals
- `Plant`: Base class for all plants
- `Mammal`: Represents herbivorous animals
- `Predator`: Represents carnivorous animals
- `Flower`: A type of plant (currently not edible)
- `Fruit`: An edible type of plant

## Class Descriptions

### Animal
- Attributes: `alive`, `fed`, `name`
- Methods: `__init__`

### Plant
- Attributes: `edible`, `name`
- Methods: `__init__`

### Mammal (inherits from Animal)
- Methods: `eat`

### Predator (inherits from Animal)
- Methods: `eat`

### Flower (inherits from Plant)
- Currently identical to Plant

### Fruit (inherits from Plant)
- Overrides `edible` to `True`

## Usage

The main script creates instances of different classes and simulates interactions between them:

```python
animal1 = Predator('Tiger')
animal2 = Mammal('Bull')
plant1 = Plant('Rose')
plant2 = Fruit('Apple')

animal1.eat(plant1)
animal2.eat(plant2)
```

The simulation then prints the results of these interactions.

## Running the Simulation

To run the simulation, execute the main script:

```
python main.py
```

## Future Improvements

- Add more types of animals and plants
- Implement a more complex ecosystem with multiple interactions
- Add graphical representation of the simulation
